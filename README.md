- Lint/format: `ruff check . && black --check .`

### Crypto Trading Activation
```bash
# Demo mode (safe testing)
python activate_crypto_trading.py --demo

# Live trading (requires API credentials)
export COINBASE_API_KEY="your_api_key"
export COINBASE_API_SECRET="your_secret"
export COINBASE_PASSPHRASE="your_passphrase"
python activate_crypto_trading.py --monitor 60
```

2. **Mean Reversion** - Statistical arbitrage with volatility clustering
3. **Cross-Asset Arbitrage** - Multi-venue price discrepancy exploitation  
4. **Trend Following** - Multi-timeframe trend detection with adaptive filters
5. **Microstructure Alpha** - Order book imbalance and flow toxicity signals

## üõ°Ô∏è Risk Management

### Portfolio Risk Controls
- **Value-at-Risk (VaR)** monitoring with 1-day and 7-day horizons
- **Maximum Drawdown** limits with real-time circuit breakers
- **Position Sizing** using Kelly-tempered allocation
- **Correlation Limits** preventing over-concentration
- **Volatility Targeting** with dynamic exposure scaling

### Crypto-Specific Risk Features
- **Regime Detection** identifying high-volatility periods
- **Liquidity Monitoring** across multiple exchanges
- **Cross-Chain Risk** assessment for bridge operations
- **Custody Controls** with hot/cold wallet thresholds

## üîß Development Roadmap

### ‚úÖ Completed (Production Ready)
- Core trading infrastructure with parallel agents
- Coinbase Pro integration with real-time WebSocket
- Multi-exchange crypto market data feeds
- Comprehensive crypto wallet management
- Advanced crypto-specific risk controls
- Production deployment infrastructure
- Persistent feature store with policy hot-reload

### üöß In Progress

- Advanced machine learning models
- Real-time performance attribution

### üéØ Future Enhancements
- Options and derivatives trading
- Cross-chain MEV strategies
- Yield farming automation
- NFT market making

Deployment

- Fly.io (preferred)
	- Export a Fly token as `FLYIO_TOKEN`.
	- Deploy both services with health checks:
		- `tools/deploy.sh fly`

- Local (Docker Compose fallback)
	- Bring up both services locally with health checks:
		- `tools/deploy.sh local`

Health endpoints

- Execution: `https://<host>:<port>/health` (local: `http://localhost:18080/health`)
- Portfolio: `https://<host>:<port>/health` (local: `http://localhost:18081/health`)

## Persistent Feature Store & Policy Hot-Reload

This codebase now includes:

1. Disk-backed Feature Store (`DiskFeatureStore`)
	- Append-only JSONL per key with auto-incrementing version and SHA-256 content hash.
	- Retrieval of historical snapshots: `history(key, limit)` and `get_version(key, n)`.
2. Policy Hot-Reload (`PolicyRegistry`)
	- Automatic mtime detection; policies reloaded when underlying YAML changes.
	- Stable `policy_hash` exposed and attached to every emitted `Signal` for auditability.

Example usage:

```python
from crowetrade.feature_store.store import DiskFeatureStore
from crowetrade.core.policy import PolicyRegistry

fs = DiskFeatureStore("./feature_history")
fs.put("AAPL", {"mom": 0.12, "vol": 0.34})
print(fs.get("AAPL").version)
print(len(fs.history("AAPL")))

registry = PolicyRegistry("specs/policies")
pol = registry.load("cs_mom_v1")
print(registry.policy_hash("cs_mom_v1"))
```

Backward compatibility: `InMemoryFeatureStore.put(key, values, version=...)` still accepted.
