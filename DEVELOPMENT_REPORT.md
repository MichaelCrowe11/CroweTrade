## 🔧 Critical Fixes Applied

### 1. Import Resolution ⚡
**Problem:** Missing `venue_adapter.py` broke execution service  
**Solution:** Created comprehensive venue adapter with mock/FIX implementations  
**Impact:** 100% test collection success  

### 2. Code Quality Cleanup 🧹
**Problem:** 507 lint violations blocking CI  
**Solution:** Auto-fixed 464 violations, modernized type annotations  
**Impact:** 91% code quality improvement  

### 3. DataClass Architecture 🏗️
**Problem:** Inheritance conflicts in Event classes  
**Solution:** Flattened dataclass hierarchy with explicit field ordering  
**Impact:** Clean import chain, stable schema contracts

## 🚀 Infrastructure Foundation

### Protobuf Service Contracts
```
proto/
├── feature.proto     # Market data & features
├── signal.proto      # Trading signals  
├── portfolio.proto   # Position targets
└── exec.proto        # Orders & fills
```

### Container Strategy
- Multi-stage builds for optimization
- Non-root security model  
- Health checks & monitoring
- Environment-based configuration

### Kubernetes Architecture
- Namespace isolation (cl-live, cl-research)
- RBAC & Pod Security Standards
- Service mesh ready
- Horizontal scaling
