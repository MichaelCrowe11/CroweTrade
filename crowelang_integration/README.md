# CroweLang Integration

This directory will contain CroweLang integration artifacts migrated from the standalone crowe-lang repository (compiler outputs, examples, and integration spec) for use inside the CroweTrade runtime.

Planned contents:
- Integration spec (`CROWETRADE_INTEGRATION.md`)
- Example CroweLang strategy (`crowetrade-agent.crowe`)
- Generated Python output for sample strategy (`crowetrade_agent.py`)
- Adapter shim to invoke the CroweLang compiler from CroweTrade build/test pipelines
- Roadmap detailing staged adoption into live agent orchestration
